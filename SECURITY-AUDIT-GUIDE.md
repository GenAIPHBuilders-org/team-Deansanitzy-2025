# Security Audit System for User Credentials

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security audit system implemented to ensure all user credentials and information are properly audited in the Firestore users collection. The system provides real-time monitoring, detailed audit trails, and automated security analysis.

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### 1. Firestore Security Rules
- **Strict Access Control**: Users can only access their own data
- **Audit Trail Requirements**: All sensitive operations require audit fields
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin-only access for system operations
- **Default Deny**: All unspecified operations are denied

### 2. Comprehensive Audit Logging
- **User-Specific Audit Logs**: Each user has their own audit trail
- **System-Wide Audit Logs**: Critical operations are logged globally
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Automatic redaction of sensitive information
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Immediate console logging for critical events

### 3. Security Monitoring
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Automated pattern recognition
- **Multiple IP Tracking**: Detection of unusual access patterns
- **Failed Attempt Monitoring**: Threshold-based alerting
- **Risk Assessment**: Dynamic risk scoring for users

## 📊 Audit Trail Structure

   - Data quality issues identification
   - Security policy compliance

2. **System Security Audit**
   - Audit log analysis (1000 most recent)
   - Critical event identification
   - Access pattern analysis
   - Risk level assessment

3. **Suspicious Activity Detection**
   - Failed attempt pattern analysis
   - Multiple IP address detection
   - Unusual access hour identification
   - Risk scoring for users

4. **Compliance Assessment**
   - Audit trail coverage percentage
   - Data retention policy compliance
   - Access control verification
   - Overall compliance scoring

### Sample Audit Output

```
📋 SECURITY AUDIT SUMMARY
=====================================
🔐 User Credentials: 145/150 users have complete credentials
🔑 Telegram Keys: 148 users with keys, 23 unused
📝 Audit Coverage: 96.7% of users have audit trails
⚠️ Risk Level: LOW
📊 Compliance Score: 87/100

🎯 TOP RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. [HIGH] Fix Missing User Data
   5 users have missing critical data fields
2. [MEDIUM] Improve Compliance Score
   Current compliance score: 87/100
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### User Data Access with Audit
```http
GET /api/user/{userId}
Authorization: Bearer {firebase-token}
X-Session-ID: {session-id}
```

### Audit Trail Access
```http
GET /api/user/{userId}/audit?limit=50
Authorization: Bearer {firebase-token}
```

### Security Status Check
```http
GET /api/user/{userId}/security-status
Authorization: Bearer {firebase-token}
```

## 🚨 Suspicious Activity Detection

### Triggers
- **Failed Attempts**: >5 failed operations in 24 hours
- **Multiple IPs**: >3 unique IP addresses in 24 hours
- **Sensitive Operations**: >5 sensitive data changes in 24 hours
- **Unusual Hours**: Activity during 10 PM - 6 AM with high volume

### Risk Scoring Formula
```
Risk Score = (Failed Attempts × 2) + (Unique IPs × 3) + (Sensitive Operations × 1)
```

### Automatic Responses
- Console warnings for suspicious users
- Enhanced audit logging
- Risk score calculation and tracking
- Flagging for manual review

## 🔧 Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Always Use Audit Context**
   ```javascript
   const auditContext = {
     ip: req.ip,
     userAgent: req.get('User-Agent'),
     path: req.path,
     method: req.method,
     sessionId: req.headers['x-session-id'] || 'unknown'
   };
   
   await dbHelpers.storeUserData(userId, data, auditContext);
   ```

2. **Log Sensitive Operations**
   ```javascript
   await dbHelpers.logUserActivity(userId, 'SENSITIVE_OPERATION', {
     ...auditContext,
     operation: 'password_change'
   }, true); // true = sensitive data
   ```

3. **Validate User Ownership**
   ```javascript
   if (req.user.uid !== userId) {
     await dbHelpers.logUserActivity(req.user.uid, 'UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS_ATTEMPT', {
       ...auditContext,
       targetUserId: userId
     }, true);
     return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied' });
   }
   ```

### For System Administrators

1. **Regular Audit Runs**
   - Schedule daily security audits
   - Monitor compliance scores
   - Review flagged users weekly

2. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Set up alerts for high-risk events
   - Monitor system audit logs
   - Track compliance trends

3. **Data Retention**
   - Archive audit logs older than 90 days
   - Maintain compliance documentation
   - Regular security assessments

## 🔮 Security Best Practices

### Data Protection
- All sensitive fields are automatically redacted in logs
- Audit operations never block main functionality
- Failed audits are logged but don't prevent operations

### Access Control
- Firestore rules enforce strict user isolation
- Admin operations require special permissions
- Default deny policy for all undefined operations

### Monitoring
- Real-time console logging for immediate awareness
- Structured logging for automated analysis
- Risk-based alerting for security events

### Compliance
- Comprehensive audit trails for all operations
- Automated compliance scoring
- Regular security assessments and recommendations

## 📈 Continuous Improvement

The security audit system is designed to evolve with your security needs:

- **Automated Threat Detection**: Machine learning-ready audit data
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance report generation
- **Integration Ready**: API endpoints for external security tools
- **Scalable Architecture**: Efficient Firestore collections structure

## 🆘 Incident Response

### High-Risk Users
1. Review audit trail using `/api/user/{userId}/audit`
2. Check security status via `/api/user/{userId}/security-status`
3. Consider temporary access restrictions
4. Investigate source IPs and access patterns

### System-Wide Threats
1. Run comprehensive audit: `node scripts/security-audit-dashboard.js`
2. Review system audit logs in Firestore
3. Analyze access patterns and trends
4. Implement additional security measures as needed
