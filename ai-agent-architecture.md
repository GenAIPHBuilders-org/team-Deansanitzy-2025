# ðŸ¤– AI Agent Architecture - Kita-kita Platform

## Overview
The Kita-kita platform implements a multi-agent architecture with autonomous AI agents that demonstrate reasoning, planning, and decision-making capabilities for financial management.

## Core Agent Framework

### 1. Agent Autonomy Framework
```javascript
class AutonomousAgent {
    constructor(agentType, capabilities) {
        this.agentType = agentType;
        this.capabilities = capabilities;
        this.decisionEngine = new DecisionEngine();
        this.planningModule = new PlanningModule();
        this.reasoningEngine = new ReasoningEngine();
        this.memorySystem = new MemorySystem();
    }

    // Autonomous decision making
    async makeDecision(context, userGoals) {
        const analysis = await this.reasoningEngine.analyze(context);
        const plan = await this.planningModule.createPlan(analysis, userGoals);
        const decision = await this.decisionEngine.decide(plan);
        
        this.memorySystem.store(context, decision, plan);
        return decision;
    }

    // Continuous learning and adaptation
    async learn(feedback, outcomes) {
        await this.reasoningEngine.updateKnowledge(feedback, outcomes);
        await this.planningModule.refineStrategies(outcomes);
    }
}
```

        this.messageQueue = new MessageQueue();
        this.coordinationEngine = new CoordinationEngine();
    }

    async coordinateAgents(agents, userContext) {
        const agentInsights = await Promise.all(
            agents.map(agent => agent.analyze(userContext))
        );
        
        const consensusDecision = await this.coordinationEngine
            .buildConsensus(agentInsights);
        
        return consensusDecision;
    }
}
```

### Decision-Making Hierarchy
1. **Individual Agent Analysis**: Each agent analyzes from their domain expertise
2. **Cross-Agent Consultation**: Agents share insights and validate decisions
3. **Consensus Building**: Coordinated recommendations are formed
4. **User Presentation**: Unified, coherent advice is presented to the user

## Advanced Reasoning Capabilities
